# TimePie
Welcome to Time Pie - a proactive time magagement application at the intersection of a guru and your mother.

By "proactive" we mean the application notices when you're not on top of your game, and gives you a nudge. You don't have to tell it what you're doing. It gets in YOUR face when you're NOT telling it what you're doing.

First, identify the "good life." (We will have a few pre-fab "good lives" built in). Next, TimePie will ping you to get a sense of whether you're investing your time in a way that is consistent with your "good life" ideal. If you're actions are not living up to that ideal, TimePie engages you in a constructive dialogue and offers you the tools needed to redisgn your life (or identify new goals), that keep you energized, focused, and the best you you and be in the world.

This is an open-source project that prioritizes design. How would you like an application to help you mangage your life? What psychological principles can be drawn upon to get you there?
